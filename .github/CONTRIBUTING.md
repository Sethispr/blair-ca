# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing, I appreciate any help you can offer. There are some couple guidelines you need to follow.

### Installing packages
```bash
npm install
```

### Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Before Sharing Changes

1. **Check formatting and code:**
```bash
npx gts lint
npx gts fix
```

This checks that your code follows the Google Typescript styleguide which uses both Prettier and ESLint. This catches style issues or any errors early.

2. **Build the project:**
```bash
npm run build
```

This is so everything compiles correctly and is ready for use.

Once your changes are ready and you've run the checks above, you can share them through a pull request. Please put a short description of what you've changed and why (try put the issue number if possible).

I'll review it and if everything looks good, I'll happily include your contribution.

Thank you again for your time and effort. I appreciate your help in making this tool better for everyone.
